## The Christmas tree was created using Javascript & can be viewed in the console.

- The code can be found in "christmasTree.js".
- If you adjust the "blocksInTree" constant, you can change the amount of blocks that the christmas tree has.

### This is what will be shown in the console

```javascript
"               |                "
"             /    \             "
"            /      \            "
"           /_      _\           "
"           /        \           "
"          /          \          "
"         /_          _\         "
"         /            \         "
"        /              \        "
"       /_              _\       "
