## The Christmas tree was created using Javascript & can be viewed in the console.

- The code can be found in "christmasTree.js".
- If you adjust the "blocksInTree" constant, you can change the amount of blocks that the Christmas tree has.
- If you adjust the "heightOfBlocksInTree" constant, you can change the height of each of the blocks in the Christmas tree.

### This is what will be shown in the console

```javascript
"              |              "
"             / \             "
"            /   \            "
"           /_   _\           "
"           /     \           "
"          /       \          "
"         /_       _\         "
